# Pizza-Order-Prototype

### This is a Team Project. Together with my colleague Laura we create a pizza website. 

### The user has the freedom to filter the pizzas and how many pizzas does he wants to order. He can also remove any pizza he wants from the order.
### The information is updated at any time so that the user knows what he ordered until that moment.

### We create endpoints to see all pizzas in the menu, all their allergens and all the orders made until that moment.

### From this project we have learned:
### - working with client-server connection
### - DOM Manipulation
### - CRUD operations in Node.js
### - styling with CSS
